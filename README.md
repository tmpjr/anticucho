Code Samples
=============

This application was architected under extreme client pressure in under 5 days. It was meant to be a "spec" but time did not allow and we just charged ahead and built at the entire application. While best practices were not always observed in terms of dependency injection and decoupling the application was very maintainable and functional considering its origin!
